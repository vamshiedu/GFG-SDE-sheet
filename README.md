GFG SDE Sheet â€“ Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the GeeksforGeeks SDE Sheet problems, primarily implemented in C++ to demonstrate my Data Structures and Algorithms skills. Each problem includes a clear explanation of the approach, time and space complexity analysis, and well-structured code that can be directly tested.
The goal of this repository is to create a strong portfolio that reflects problem-solving skills, coding standards, and consistency across various topics such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.

Currently, I am solving problems in C++, and soon I will extend the solutions to Python, Java, and JavaScript to showcase versatility across multiple languages. This will also help in preparing for interviews where different companies prefer different tech stacks.

Each solution is written with readability and efficiency in mind, including comments explaining the intuition and reasoning behind the approach. The repository will continuously evolve as I progress, with future updates covering more languages, patterns, and problem variations.

This project is not only about solving problems but also about practicing clean coding, analyzing problem patterns, and building a comprehensive study resource for interview preparation.

âœ… Current focus: Solving all problems in C++ðŸš€ Upcoming: Ports to Python, Java, JavaScriptðŸ“š Covers: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, and more.

This repository will act as proof of my problem-solving journey and a showcase of my preparation for coding interviews at top companies.
