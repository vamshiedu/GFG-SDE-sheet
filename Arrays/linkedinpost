🚀 30-Day Challenge Begins! 🚀

Today, I’m starting a 30 Days Challenge to complete the GeeksforGeeks SDE Sheet 💻.

 This sheet covers all the essential Data Structures & Algorithms topics that are crucial for interviews and building a strong problem-solving foundation.

But I don’t want to stop at just solving problems — I’ll also be building projects alongside to truly understand how DSA concepts are applied in real-world applications. 🌍✨



🔑 Why this challenge?

Strengthen problem-solving and analytical thinking

Improve consistency and discipline

Learn how DSA powers real applications by combining theory with practice

Prepare for top product-based company interviews

📅 Plan:

Solve SDE Sheet questions every day (C++ first, later Python/Java/JS)

Share progress regularly

Build small-to-medium projects to apply DSA knowledge practically



✅ Today’s Progress: Solved problems from arrays

  1. Remove duplicates and Missing number with 3 approaches.

  2. Buy and Sell stocks with 2 approaches.

  3. Remove duplicates from the array with 2 approaches.

  4. Convert Array in Zig Zag fashion with 2 approaches.



 📂 GitHub Repository for all solutions: https://github.com/vamshiedu/GFG-SDE-sheet



Solving various coding problems is not the only skill we need, we need to know where to apply efficiently which improve overall system scalability and performance. on my journey i'll build various projects with DS and algo i learnt along the way.



Feel free to join with me to the challenge and Upskill..
